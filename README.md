# Expenser - Expense Tracking Mobile App

A comprehensive expense tracking mobile application built with Flutter that works offline, integrates with currency conversion APIs, supports pagination, and features a modern, user-friendly design.

## Features

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & State Management
- **BLoC Pattern**: Uses `flutter_bloc` for state management across all features
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized with separate layers for models, repositories, services, and UI
- **Reactive UI**: UI components react to state changes using BlocBuilder and BlocListener

### üí∞ Core Features

#### 1. Dashboard Screen
- User welcome message with profile display
- Total balance, income, and expenses summary
- Filter options (This Month, Last 7 Days, etc.)
- Recent expenses list with pagination
- Floating action button to add new expenses

#### 2. Add Expense Screen
- Category selection with intuitive icons
- Amount input with currency selection
- Date picker for expense date
- Receipt image upload functionality
- Form validation and error handling

#### 3. Currency Conversion
- Real-time exchange rate fetching from open APIs
- Automatic conversion to USD for consistent storage
- Support for multiple popular currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.)
- Offline fallback rates when API is unavailable

#### 4. Pagination & Filtering
- Infinite scroll pagination (10 items per page)
- Filter by time periods (This Month, Last 7 Days, etc.)
- Search functionality across expenses
- Loading states and error handling

#### 5. Local Storage
- **Hive Database**: Fast, lightweight local storage
- Offline-first approach with data persistence
- Automatic data synchronization

### üé® Design Implementation
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI components and theming
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for consistent typography
- **Custom Color Scheme**: Blue-based theme matching the provided design
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Loading states and transitions

## API Integration

### Currency Conversion API
- **Primary**: `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD` (No API key required)
- **Fallback**: Local exchange rates for offline functionality
- **Caching**: 1-hour cache to minimize API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to cached or default rates

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

### Test Coverage
- **Model Tests**: Data model creation, validation, and equality
- **Service Tests**: Currency conversion logic and API integration
- **Utility Tests**: Currency formatting and parsing functions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing

### Running Tests
```bash
flutter test
